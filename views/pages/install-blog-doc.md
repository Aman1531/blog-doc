## How to install and use Blog-Doc ?

Blog-Doc is a `Node.js` app. You should have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) on your machine.  
Always go for the **LTS** version. At the time of writing those lines it's 18.12.1 !

To install it, just head over it's [Github repository](https://github.com/LebCit/blog-doc) and download it.  
You can also download it's zip by clicking on the following link : [Bloc-Doc ZIP](https://github.com/LebCit/blog-doc/archive/refs/heads/master.zip).

Once everything is in place, extract the zipped files to a new folder and open it in your IDE (I use the one and only [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)).  
Then type in the terminal :

```bash
npm install
```

After the install, you can begin to use the app by creating [Posts and Pages](/posts-and-pages) and also [Templates](/templates) to display your content.

## Nota Bene

This page was rendered by using the **pages** option of [The files route](/the-files-route).

You can take Blog-Doc as a prototype and modify it totally to use it with another design and/or another template language (I use the one and only plain JavaScript [EJS](https://ejs.co/)).

I really hope that this app will be useful in any way for a lot of people out there, I'm considering it as my personal contribution to the Node.js, Express, EJS and Markdown communities.
