# All Posts

All created posts are displayed in a table with pagination, showing 5 posts per page.

1. **Pagination**:

    - When there are more than 5 posts, pagination buttons are available to navigate through the table.
    - Pagination buttons are located at the bottom of the table, allowing you to move between different pages of posts.

2. **Search Function**:

    - The table includes a search function that searches across all posts.
    - The search input is located above the table. As you type, the table dynamically filters the posts to match the search query.
    - If the search results exceed 5 posts, pagination is applied to the filtered results.

3. **Sorting**:

    - Posts can be sorted by clicking on the sorting arrows in the column headers.
    - Each column header (except for the "Delete" column) has two arrows for sorting: an upward arrow for ascending order and a downward arrow for descending order.
    - Sorting is applied to the currently displayed search results, ensuring that only the filtered posts are sorted.

4. **Deleting Posts**:
    - To delete a post, click on the bin icon in the "Delete" column.
    - This will trigger a confirmation modal. If you confirm the deletion, the post and all its associated data will be permanently erased.
    - Please note that deleted posts cannot be recovered.
