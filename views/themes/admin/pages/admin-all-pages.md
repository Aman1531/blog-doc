# All Pages

All created pages are displayed in a table with pagination, showing 5 pages per page.

1. **Pagination**:

    - When there are more than 5 pages, pagination buttons are available to navigate through the table.
    - Pagination buttons are located at the bottom of the table, allowing you to move between different pages of pages.

2. **Search Function**:

    - The table includes a search function that searches across all pages.
    - The search input is located above the table. As you type, the table dynamically filters the pages to match the search query.
    - If the search results exceed 5 pages, pagination is applied to the filtered results.

3. **Sorting**:

    - Pages can be sorted by clicking on the sorting arrows in the column headers.
    - Each column header (except for the "Delete" column) has two arrows for sorting: an upward arrow for ascending order and a downward arrow for descending order.
    - Sorting is applied to the currently displayed search results, ensuring that only the filtered pages are sorted.

4. **Deleting Pages**:
    - To delete a page, click on the bin icon in the "Delete" column.
    - This will trigger a confirmation modal. If you confirm the deletion, the page and all its associated data will be permanently erased.
    - Please note that deleted pages cannot be recovered.
