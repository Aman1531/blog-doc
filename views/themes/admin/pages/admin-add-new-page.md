# Create New Page

To create a new page:

-   Give the page a title (mandatory/required).
-   Give it a description (optional but good for SEO).
-   Add an image to the page (optional but better for design).
-   Publish the page or save it as a draft for later use (mandatory/required).
-   Type the page's content using Markdown syntax (mandatory/required). Blog-Doc uses the [Simple Markdown Editor](https://simple-markdown-editor.pages.dev/), a lightweight and efficient alternative to heavier libraries for writing and editing Markdown content.
-   Click on the "Create new page" button, you'll be redirected to the newly created page.
-   The title of your page will determine the `path` part of the URL to this page. Here's how it works:

    1. Choose a title for your page, such as **My awesome page title**.
    2. This title will be transformed into a URL-friendly format.
    3. The resulting URL will be structured as **`https://domain.name/pages/my-awesome-page-title`**

    For instance, if you set your page title to **Blog-Doc is awesome**, the URL to access this page will be:<br>
    **`https://domain.name/pages/blog-doc-is-awesome`**
