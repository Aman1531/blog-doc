# Edit page: {{pageTitle}}

You have several options for updating this page. You can modify the following elements:

-   **Title**: Update the page's title to reflect the content more accurately.
-   **Description**: Modify the page's description to better summarize what the page is about.
-   **Image**: Change or add an image that represents the content of the page.
-   **Publish State**: Adjust whether the page is published or in draft mode.
-   **Content**: Edit the main content of the page to update or add information.

**Important Note**: The **URL path** for this page will remain unchanged even if you change the page title.

For example, if the original title of the page was **"My Page"** and you change it to **"My Awesome Page"**, the URL to access this page will still be:

**`https://domain.name/pages/my-page`**

This URL is tied to the pageâ€™s unique identifier and remains consistent even if you update the title, ensuring that users can always access the page via the same link.
