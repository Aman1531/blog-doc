-   **Description**: Modify the post's description to better summarize what the post is about.
-   **Image**: Add a new image or change the existing one for the post.

-   **Tags**: Add or update tags to categorize the post and improve discoverability.
-   **Publish State**: Adjust whether the post is published or in draft mode.
-   **Content**: Edit the main body of the post to update or add information.

**Important Note**: The **URL path** for this post will remain unchanged even if you change the post title.

For example, if the original title of the post was **"My Post"** and you change it to **"My Awesome Post"**, the URL to access this post will still be:

**`https://domain.name/posts/my-post`**
