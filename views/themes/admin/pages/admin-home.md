# Blog-Doc

Welcome to the administration homepage of Blog-Doc.

## Administration

Beginning with [version 3.0.0](https://github.com/LebCit/blog-doc/releases/tag/v3.0.0), Blog-Doc has been improved and streamlined with the integration of [LiteNode](https://www.npmjs.com/package/litenode).<br>
The administration interface of Blog-Doc is now more user-friendly, with each page featuring its own documentation for ease of use and entirely made with [responsive attributes](https://responsive-attributes-generator.pages.dev/).
