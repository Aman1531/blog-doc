The [archive](/posts) and [tags](/tags) pages look a lot like the blog page, but with one key difference: they donâ€™t have pagination.

The archive page displays a reversed chronological list of all the published posts, from newest to oldest. Meanwhile, the tags page shows an alphabetized list of all the tags used across the posts, along with the number of times each tag appears.
