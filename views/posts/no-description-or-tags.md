This post is for testing the output of an article that doesn't have a description or even a tag. Everything seems to be okay since the display of the tags and their respective numbers are not affected by the absence of tags in a post on the [Tags](/tags) route.

## Note

While creating a post, you can leave the `description` and/or the `tags` empty, they will not be render.<vr />
Please keep in mind that if you are creating a post manually, you **must** add those properties to the front matter of the file and leave them empty like so:
