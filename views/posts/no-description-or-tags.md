This post is for testing the output of an article that doesn't have a description or even a tag. Everything seems to be okay since the display of the tags and their respective numbers are not affected by the absence of tags in a post on the [Tags](/tags) route.

<h2>Note</h2>

While manually creating a post, remove the optional `description`, `tags` and `featuredImage` properties if you don't intend to use them.<br />
Please keep in mind that if you are creating a post manually, the mandatory/required properties of the front matter are `title`, `publish_date` and `published`:
