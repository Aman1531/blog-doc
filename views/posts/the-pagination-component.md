In this post, we’ll dive into the pagination component of the blog and how it appears on the front end.

The pagination component is managed by a file called `pagination.html`, which handles how the pagination looks and works. This file is used by the `index.html` layout file to include pagination on the blog’s main page if there are enough posts.

The pagination component only shows up when needed. If there are more posts than fit on one page, the pagination will appear. This helps avoid cluttering the page with unnecessary navigation links when there's no need for them.

Here’s how it works on the front end:

-   **Homepage Pagination**: On the homepage, the pagination includes links to older posts and sometimes a link to the last page of the blog if there are more pages. This ensures that visitors can easily navigate through the entire blog.

-   **Other Pages**: For pages beyond the homepage, the pagination checks if there are previous and next pages available. It displays links accordingly, allowing users to move through pages of posts.

    -   **Not on the Last Page**: If you’re on a page that has more pages after it, you’ll see links to go to the last page and the previous page.

    -   **On the Last Page**: If you’re on the last page, the pagination will adjust to show links to earlier pages and possibly the homepage.

The pagination logic is designed to make navigation smooth, regardless of which page you’re on. It ensures that you always have easy access to other pages, whether you’re viewing the latest posts or browsing through older ones.

And that’s a wrap on how the pagination component helps you navigate through the blog’s pages. See you in the next post!
