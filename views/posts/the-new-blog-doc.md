In the vast landscape of Node.js apps, Blog-Doc shines as a tiny flame in the darkness of error.  
It is a remarkable and unique combination of a Content Management System (CMS) and a Static Site Generator (SSG) built entirely with Node.js.<br/>
While paying homage to the developers of other Node.js-based Static Site Generators, Blog-Doc sets itself apart by offering unparalleled simplicity and speed.

## Nota bene

**The [previous post](/posts/templates) has been retained for demonstration purposes, but its content is no longer relevant to the new version of Blog-Doc.**

Blog-Doc's latest version proudly employs:

-   [Hono](https://hono.dev/), small, simple, and ultrafast web framework for the Edges.
